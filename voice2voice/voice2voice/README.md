Training and Testing Procedures
1. Data Preparation
Organize your dataset in the data/raw directory with pairs of input/output audio files

Create a data/splits directory with:

train_files.txt (list of input|output pairs)

val_files.txt

test_files.txt

Example format:

text
input_001.wav|output_001.wav
input_002.wav|output_002.wav
2. Training the Model
bash

python scripts/train.py --config configs/base_config.yaml


Training options can be modified in configs/base_config.yaml.

3. Testing/Inference


For file-to-file conversion:

bash
python scripts/inference.py \
    --config configs/base_config.yaml \
    --model path_to_best_model.pth \
    --input input_audio.wav \
    --output output_audio.wav


    
For real-time processing (example):

python
processor = RealTimeVoiceProcessor('configs/base_config.yaml', 'best_model.pth')

# In a real-time loop:
while True:
    audio_chunk = get_audio_chunk()  # Your audio input function
    output_chunk = processor.process_chunk(audio_chunk)
    play_audio(output_chunk)         # Your audio output function
Additional Notes
Data Requirements:

At least 50 hours of paired voice data recommended

Consistent audio quality and sample rate

Balanced distribution of speech patterns

Performance Optimization:

Use mixed precision training (torch.cuda.amp)

Implement gradient checkpointing for larger models

Use TorchScript for production deployment

Advanced Techniques:

Add adversarial loss for better audio quality

Implement voice activity detection for real-time processing

Add speaker embeddings for multi-speaker support

This complete implementation provides everything needed to build, train, and deploy a direct voice-to-voice model without text intermediates. The architecture is designed for real-time performance while maintaining high-quality voice output.
